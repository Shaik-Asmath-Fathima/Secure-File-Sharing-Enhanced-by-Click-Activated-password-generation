Most of the security measures provided are based on hard mathematical problems we are going to present a new security measure based on hard AI problem, namely, a novel family of graphical password systems built on top of Captcha technology, which we call Captcha as graphical passwords (CaRP). CaRP is both a Captcha and a graphical password scheme .
CaRP addresses a number of security problems altogether, such as online guessing attacks, relay attacks, and , if combined with dual-view technologies, shoulders- surfing attacks .Notably, a CaRP password can be found only probabilistically by automatic online guessing attacks even if the password is in the search set .CaRP also offers a novel approach to address the wellknown image hotspot problem in popular graphical password systems, such as Pass Points, 
that often leads to weak password choice. CaRP is not a panacea, but it offers reasonable security and usability and appears to fit well with some practical applications for improving online security.
